* Chrome extension to promote better technical interview prep on leetcode by prompting user to talk through the problem while coding.
* Note: This is a personal project, I do not intend to publish full pokedex functionality since I do not own pokemon.
## In-progress:
- timer functionality
- display analytics for speech captured (how long did user actively talk, how clear was it etc...)
- saving progress in local storage or write to an excel sheet or making a dashboard
- Adding sample Pokedex interface
## Installation (requires npm installed):
1) Download the project files
2) In terminal use "npm run build" to create the build file 
3) In chrome tab, navigate to chrome://extensions/ 
4) Click Load unpack button and select build folder
5) Pin the extension to your browser and click icon to view your pokedex (Optional)
